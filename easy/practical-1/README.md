Make sure to fork this project into your portfolio space before progressing 
with the practical. if you do not do this, then your changes may not be saved

Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/24644/pages/forking-or-cloning-a-project?module_item_id=1228552)

A video showing a step by step on how to do this can be found [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/4ecb0839-6fd9-48bc-b563-3ab2122ef011)

## practical-1.1

In the file called `HelloWorld.java`, fill in the main method to print out to console
your name, 'CSC8011 Introduction to Software Engineering', and 'Hello World'.

Expected Output:

```
(your name)
CSC8011 Introduction to Software Engineering
Hello World
```

*Hint: Use `System.out.println("text");` to print a line of output*

To compile and run your code, refer to the instructions on IDE and compilation in the lecture notes. Ask a demonstrator or the module leader
if you are having any difficulty with this.

## practical-1.2

In the method called `addition` print out to console the result of 100 + 50

Expected Result:

```
150
```

### practical-1.2.1

Extension: Remove the values 100 and 50. Create two variables `x` and `y` and
assign 100 and 50 to those variables. Create a third variable `z` and assign the
sum of `x` and `y`. Print to console the value of `z`

### practical-1.2.2

Extension: In the main method, print out the results of the following operations

- -22 + 3 * 2
- (9/2) % 9
- 2,147,483,646 + -15 / 2
- (-2,147,483,646 + -1000/ 2) * 10

Observe the product of the above operations in Java and figure out why you are
receiving those results. 

Expected Output:

```
-16
4
2147483639
-4980
```
## practical-1.3

Research Task: Using the lecture material, and resources that you have found
online, write a **200** word report in markdown in the **report.md** file about
your understanding of the following topics in Java:

- Naming Convention
- Commenting
- Sourcing Material Online
- The compiling process

This is a formative task, try and be clear and concise in your discussion in the
report.

See [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for
guidance on how to write in markdown.

## practical-1.4

In the main method, print the sum for the addition, multiply, subtract, divide
and remainder of two numbers `x` and `y` where:

```
int x = 250;
int y = 72;
```

Expected Output:

```
322
18000
178
3
34
```

## practical-1.5

In the method `fancyPrint` complete the method to display the following pattern


```
   J    a   v     v  a                                                                                        
   J   a a   v   v  a a                                                                                       
J  J  aaaaa   V V  aaaaa                                                                                      
 JJ  a     a   V  a     a 
```

*Hint: Nothing too fancy is expected here. System.out.println is enough*
